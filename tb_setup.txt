How to Run the Test Bench:

Structure Setup: (You can Ignore this step if extracting from project_sK.zip or using the git, the below structure is already present in the zip file with ModelSim project in it)
1) Create a folder with any name. Setup 3 folders in that folder[sim,src,tb]
2) src contains the design soruce code
3) tb contains the test bench files
4) sim -- Project Directory

Setting up the ModelSim project:
1) Create a new project
2) Give the working directory as sim
3) Add Existing files -- all files from tb and src folder
4) Once this is done, copy the bit_tb.do file into the sim folder.(This file might already be present in the structure in the project_sK.zip)
5) On the command line in ModelSim, run the following command: do bit_tb.do
6) Text files will be generated in the sim folder by the name ref_results.txt and test_vectors.txt.

Python code setup:
TEST Generation
1) copy the address of the folder sim and paste it in the Python file to set the output address for the test file to be generated. for eg: file=open('E:\velodyne\sim\test_vectors.txt','w');
2) It is important that the test file generated should be in the folder same as that of the ModelSim project folder. TB is going to read tests from this file eventually.
